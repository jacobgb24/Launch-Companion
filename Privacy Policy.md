###Privacy Policy

Launch Companion uses Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crash which collect user information. These services are used to improve the application's stability and usefulness. This information allows me to see what features are being used and to focus development on important areas of the app. Crash reports are helpful because they allow me to locate bugs I may not have found otherwise.

###Data Collected through analytics
* Age
* Country
* Gender
* Phone Model
* Carrier
* OS version
* Usage of app (ie: when a reminder is created or how long the app is opened for)

This data will not distributed to any third parties. The data is also anonymous and is not linked to a user with any private information or unique identifiers. This means that I do not know any information about any specific users. I only know the general demographics and app usage for the user base as a whole.


###Disabling data collection
To disable data collection check the setting to disable Analytics collections. This will not disable crash reports which only collect information relevant to the application's performance.

###About this policy
This policy is subject to change. Please check this page for the latest privacy policy. If you have any concerns about this privacy policy please contact me through email, which can be found in the about section of the app or in the Play Store listing.
